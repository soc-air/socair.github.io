This is an emotional, honest and a thank you post! This blog just completed 50,000 views with over 9k users from more than 100 countries over the world! It's overwhelimg and I want to share how I feel about this in a series of posts. But not just this, this post will not just narrate *my* journey, but the journey of *many* those who had the courage to dream.

Before I start this off, I want to say something to **YOU**:

1. Thank you for making me feel special.
2. Thank you for coming over here, reading my content, and giving it your time.
3. Thank you for your love, I do feel loved.
4. Thank you for your time.

For those who don't know me, I've a habit of thanking people quite often. And I intend to carry it on forever. Here is me, just in another way, expressing gratitude to each and every one of you. Whether you love me or hate me, I know you know me ;) This is Kushashwa Ravi Shrimali (friends call me Kush, many know me as krshrimali and on <a href="https://youtube.com/c/kushashwaraviShrimali">YouTube</a> - they call me *Ravi Bhai*/*Ravi Sir*). And, here we go!

While many take `.github.io` domain to host their portfolio, unlike them - I started this to write and share the things I know. I always wanted to reach out to more people than the ones around me. Apart from sharing this on my public & private social handles, I never promoted this blog (and I don't intend to, in near future). Summer 2019, I interned at ROSE Labs in NTU Singapore, where I realized the importance of **time**, **discipline** and also C++ (odd one out? ;)). More than C++, it was about the courage to read the source code. Summer 2019, was the time when I came to know that there exists something like PyTorch C++ API. It was huge for me, back then when I started. It was so interesting, that when I came back to India, I immediately talked to a few people on how I can get comfortable with the source code. I started making slides while reading the source code, and would share to the one of the best person I've ever met: Will Feng (<a href="https://github.com/yf225">GitHub</a>). He was kind enough to suggest me the next steps, I was still trying hard to contribute. Not because it would get me somewhere, it was just a passion to read the source code and be able to add a few lines to help the community. But, I was still a beginner in the community...I wasn't sure where to kick this off. And then, as always, there was one guy who came up with this idea. His name is, **Vishwesh Ravi Shrimali**, my elder brother, guide, teacher, buddy and best friend! This is how it began:

**Vishwesh:** "Trust me Kush, you should write blogs"

**Me:** "But I don't know if it will work..."

**Vishwesh:** "Give it a try, then we'll see"

**Me:** "Okay! But will you review it once?"

**Vishwesh:** "Arey, why not? Tu likh bas!" (Hey, why not? You just write once.)

I would always listen to him, and I'm glad I did at that time. That's where this blog started. I wrote my first blog, shared on my LinkedIn and twitter. Since I was just starting, I wanted to know if it's the right content to share with the readers. I wasn't aiming to be popular, I was just trying to help. One day, while scrolling through PyTorch Forums, I found this guy named **Piotr Bialecki**. I know, many know him as `ptrblck`, but for me - he has done wonders. He would not just give feedback but also suggest improvements, he was very kind! Piotr and Will, if they weren't there, I'm sure I wouldn't be here. Thank you!

I didn't know that there was a thing called `analytics.google.com`. And boom, one day I checked it, and I was happy to see the love. 10k views, quite a lot of users, from all around the world. I knew I was responsible to share more, but I was focused on quality. Since I was interning at NVIDIA HQ in Santa Clara, I was really busy. I wanted to learn as much as I can, but was equally focused on contributing to the team. **Michael Carilli**, my mentor at NVIDIA, was too kind to guide me through. I still dream to be like him one day. During my time at NVIDIA, I learnt a lot from my team (PyTorch Dev Team). And my dream came true, I was able to contribute to PyTorch and help the community. While many talk about how amazing the PyTorch community is, I realized it when I met **Mike Ruberry** (a PyTorch Developer at Facebook). He was very kind when I met him, we happened to talk about something other than work as well (is it rare in the silicon valley? ;)). He guided me and helped me even after I left the place, you are as amazing as one can get, Ruberry!

While many have second thoughts while working for a startup, I must say, I was (and still am) thrilled to join <a href="https://www.care.ai">CareAI</a> (where I am an AI Engineer right now). The impact the team brings, is amazing and am happy to contribute there. Special thanks to my mentor and manager, **Aniket Vartak**, for helping me learn all the new things. Thank you, Aniket!

This blog can not end without thanking my readers, thank you people! Thank you for all the love! Wait, I'm missing someone. Yes, my parents! They are God to me, and I'll go and thank them personally! Thank you, everyone.

This has been the story so far, but it's not the end. The story is long, and I will keep it short for now. I'll come back and write a few more words to narrate how I started. I'll continue writing content that helps the people out there. Just in case, if you don't know - I also have a <a href="https://youtube.com/c/kushashwaraviShrimali">YouTube channel</a>. Make sure to check it out as I'm trying to be share content over there as well.
