I'm a Computer Science graduate from IIIT Naya Raipur, India (2016-20). I love development which makes AI happen in real-time scenarios. And I love writing impactful codes. I am currently working as an AI Engineer at <a href="https://care.ai">CareAI</a>, which is a US-based healthcare startup. I was also a R&D DL Engineer for a short span of time at Dukaan, an Indian strartup based in Bengaluru.
