## About Me

Hello World! I'm Kushashwa Ravi Shrimali, Final Year Undergraduate at International Institute of Information Technology, Naya Raipur with major in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm currently interning at Florida based healthcare startup, Care AI (http://care.ai/) as a Software Developer (AI). I've previously worked at NVIDIA (Santa Clara, US) in the DL Frameworks Team (PyTorch), ROSE Labs, NTU Singapore (CV and DL) and with a US based Startup, Big Vision LLC and LearnOpenCV under mentorship of Dr. Satya Mallick. I love development which brings an impact in helping AI algorithms to be deployed in real-time scenarios.

Please navigate to <a href="https://krshrimali.github.io/pytorch/">PyTorch</a> or <a href="https://krshrimali.github.io/cpp/">C++</a> section of this blog to read my blogs.

## Work Experience

- **Care AI (Software Developer Intern, AI), Florida, US** (April 2020 to Present)
    - Remotely working (due to COVID-19 pandemic). Major responsibilities include:
        * Optimizing workflow using TensorRT (mainly using C++ API).
	* Applying Deep Learning, Speech Recognition and Machine Learning models on Android Apps.
    - _Note: This will be updated with time. :)_
- **NVIDIA (Deep Learning Frameworks Team, PyTorch), Santa Clara, US**
    - On site internship at NVIDIA Head Quarters, Santa Clara. See the following PRs if you want to know what I worked on.
