In this blog, we'll continue diving deep into the source code of Vector Containers in GCC compiler. Today, we will be discussing some of the most commonly used methods of vectors, and how they are implemented.

Before we start, if you haven't looked at the previous blogs in the C++ series, please take a look <a href="http://www.krshrimali.github.io/cpp">here</a>. If you are already familiar with memory allocation in vector containers and vector's base structs, then you can skip reading the previous blogs and continue here. If not, I suggest you reading them.

Let's start off with `pop_back` member function, which essentially deletes the last element from the vector and reduces the size by one. Let's take a look how it is used:

```cpp
# Initialize a vector using initializer list
std::vector<int> X {1, 2, 3};
X.pop_back();
for (auto const& element: X) {
    std::cout << element << " ";
}
```

You will see the output as: `1 2`. If you are wondering how this works in the case of a 2D vector, let's take a look:

```cpp
# Initialize a 2D vector using initializer list
std::vector<std::vector<int>> X { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} };
X.pop_back();
for (auto const& element: X) {
    for (auto const& _element: element) {
        std::cout << _element << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "\n";
}
```
You will see the output as: `1 2 3`. As you can notice, it popped back the last element which was indeed a vector. Let's start diving deep in the source code now, starting with declaration:

```cpp
void pop_back() _GLIBCXX_NOEXCEPT
{
    __glibcxx_required_nonempty();
    __this->_M_impl._M_finish;
    _Alloc_traits::destroy(this->_M_impl, this->_M_impl._M_finish);
    _GLIBCXX_ASAN_ANNOTATE_SHRINK(1);
}
```

A short note on `_GLIBCXX_NOEXCEPT` operator (`noexcept` since C++11): It returns true if the expression or member function is required to not throw any exceptions. `_GLIBCXX_NOEXCEPT` is defined as `noexcept` for C++ versions >= 2011:

```cpp
if __cplusplus >= 201103L
    # define _GLIBCXX_NOEXCEPT noexcept
```

You can use a condition by using `_GLIBCXX_NOEXCEPT_IF(condition)` which essentially calls `noexcept(condition)`. One use of this is when you want to access a particular index in a vector, you can avoid check if the location exists or not by using `noexcept`.

When you call `pop_back` the design rule first checks if the vector is empty or not. If it's nonempty, only then it makes sense to pop the last element, right? This is done by using `__glibcxx_required_nonempty()` call. The definition of this macro is:

```cpp
# define __glibcxx_requires_nonempty() __glibcxx_check_nonempty()
```

As you can see, it's calling `__glibcxx_check_nonempty()` macro which checks using `this->empty()` call:

```cpp
# define __glibcxx_check_nonempty() \
_GLIBCXX_DEBUG_VERIFY(! this->empty(), _M_message(::__gnu_debug::__msg_empty)._M_sequence(*this, "this))
```

These are typical GCC macros for assertions. If we the vector is nonempty, we now move forward in fetching the last location in the memory of our vector container (using `_M_impl._M_finish` pointer), please take a look at the previous blogs if you aren't aware of `_M_impl` struct. As the term suggests, we attempt to destroy the memory location using `_Alloc_traits::destroy(this->_M_impl, this->_M_impl._M_finish)`. `_Alloc_traits` allows us to access various properties of the allocator used.

```cpp
// This function destroys an object of type _Tp
template <typename _Tp>
static void destroy(_Alloc& __a, _Tp& __p)
noexcept(noexcept(_S_destroy(__a, __p, 0))
{ _S_destroy(__a, __p, 0); }
```

According to the official documentation of `destroy` static function: It calls `__a.destroy(__p) if that expression is well-formed, other wise calls __p->~_Tp()`. If we take a look at the existing overloads of `_S_destroy`:

```cpp
template <typename _Alloc2, typename _Tp>
static auto _S_destroy(_Alloc2& __a, _Tp* __p, int) noexcept(noexcept(__a.destroy(__p)))
-> decltype(__a.destroy(__p))
{ __a.destroy(__p); }

template <typename _Alloc2, typename _Tp>
static void _S-destroy(_Alloc2& __a, _Tp* __p, ...) noexcept(noexcept(__p->~_Tp()))
{ __p->~_Tp(); }
```

So clearly, if the expression is well-formed, it will call our allocator's destroy method and pass the pointer location in that call. Otherwise, it calls the destructor of the pointer itself (`__p->~_Tp()`). Once successfully done, we reduce the size by 1 using:

```cpp
# define _GLIBCXX_ASAN_ANNOTATE_SHRINK(n) \
  _Base::_Vector_impl::template _Asan<>::_S_shrink(this->_M_impl, n)
```

As you would see, the macro calls `_S_shrink` function to sanitize the vector container (i.e. reduce the size by n, here 1):

```cpp
template <typename _Up>
  struct _Asan<allocator<_Up>>
  {
    static void _S_adjust(_Vector_impl& __impl, pointer __prev, pointer _curr)
    { __sanitizer_annotate_contiguous_container(__impl._M_start, __impl._M_end_of_storage, __prev, __curr); }

    static void _S_shrink(_Vector_impl& __impl, size_type __n)
    { _S_adjust(__impl, __impl._M_finish + __n, __impl._M_finish); }
  }
```

We don't need to go deeper into these calls, but (as per official documentation), the call `_S_adjust` adjusts ASan annotation for `[_M_start, _M_end_of_storage)` to mark end of valid region as `__curr` instead of `__prev` (note that we already had deleted the last element, so `__impl.__M_finish + __n` (here `__n` is 1) will be the old pointer).

A good useful note here is, that `pop_back` function isn't marked `noexcept` as we already have conditions to check the container being non-empty. In case there is any failure, the debug macros are called and throw necessary exceptions.

Let's go ahead and take a look at a few other member functions (there are many, take a look here: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector, I only discuss those which are commonly used)

1. `back()`
2. `front()`
3. `reserve()`
4. `size()`
5. `capacity()`

1. `back()`: Let's take a look at `back` call. As the name suggests (and as we saw before), this returns the last element in the vector container. It can be used as `X.back()` where `X` is a valid vector container. Let's take a look at how it is implemented in GCC:

    ```cpp
    reference back() _GLIBCXX_NOEXCEPT
    {
        _glibcxx_requires_nonempty();
        return *(end() - 1);
    }
    
    // definition of end()
    iterator end() _GLIBCXX_NOEXCEPT
    {
        return iterator(this->_M_impl._M_finish);
    }
    ```
    
    Note that `end()` points to one past the last element in the vector. That's why we do `end()-1` in the definition of `back` function. This should now be pretty obvious, that why use assertion `_glibcxx_requires_nonempty()` as we want to make sure that we are returning valid memory location.
   
2. `front()`: It should be very similar to what we saw with `back()`. This returns reference to the first element of the vector.
   
    ```cpp
    reference front() _GLIBCXX_NOEXCEPT
    {
        _glibcxx_requires_nonempty();
        return *begin();
    }

    // definition of begin()
    iterator begin() _GLIBCXX_NOEXCEPT
    {
        return iterator(this->_M_impl._M_start);
    }
    ```
    
    Note how we use the pointers `_M_start` and `_M_finish` to access first and the last elements of the vector container respectively.

3. `reserve()`: Some times we want to pre-allocate memory to a vector container. You can do that using `X.reserve(10)` to reserve enough size for 10 elements (integers if X is `std::vector<int>` type).

    ```cpp
    void reserve(size_type __n)
    {
        if (__n > max_size())
            _throw_length_error(__N("vector::reserve"));
        if (capacity() < __n)
            _M_reallocate(__n);
    }
    ```

    So when you want to pre-allocate memory, there are 3 possibilities:
    * There is already enough memory allocated. No need to allocate. (Case of `capacity() > __n`)
    * There is not enough memory allocated. Need to reallocate memory. (Case of `capacity() < __n`)
    * The required size is greater than maximum size possible, then lenght error is thrown. (Case of `__n > max_size()`)

4. `size()`: This will return the size of the vector container:

    ```cpp
    size_type size() const _GLIBCXX_NOEXCEPT
    {
        return size_type(end() - begin());
    }
    ```

    So, let's say you have reserved memory for 10 elements, then `size()` will return 10.

5. `capacity()`: This returns the size the container can store currently.

    ```cpp
    size_type capacity() const _GLIBCXX_NOEXCEPT
    {
        return size_type(const_iterator(this->_M_impl._M_end_addr(), 0) - begin());
    }
    ```

    Here, `_M_end_addr()` returns address of (end of storage + 1) location (if the pointer to `this->_M_impl._M_end_of_storage` exists).

There maybe a few member functions that I missed, but I'm sure the tutorials so far in the Vectors series are (hopefully) enough to help you out with understanding the source code.

With this blog post, we are also done with the vector series in C++, and coming up next, we will take a look on using all of this knowledge to implement useful utilities for vectors while implementing libraries and projects, and also other design patterns in C++.
