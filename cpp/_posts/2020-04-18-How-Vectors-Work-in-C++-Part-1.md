This blog is focused to explain how vectors work in the backend, and we'll specially look at `push_back` method of the vector container. Looking at the source code helps to understand the implementation, and how vectors can be used efficiently.

Vector Containers are type of sequenced containers in C++ commonly uses as a better alternative of arrays. They are also known as dynamic arrays, and as the term suggests - it's one of the advantages they hold over native arrays in C++. You might have heard of Standard Library containers like `vector`, `set`, `queue`, `priority_queue` before. They all implement methods defined by the Container Concept.

**A few important notes before we start:**

- I'm using GCC 10.0.1 which is in the development stage. I've built GCC 10.0.1 from source on my local system. But everything I discuss here, should be same with GCC 8.4 or GCC 9.3 releases.
- I assume you are at least using C++11. If for any reason you are using C++98, there might be a few differences (for example, variadic arguments were not present in C++98). To not include lots of macros to check C++ versions, I've at times assumed the reader is using C++11 or greater.
- This blog uses lots of C++ Design Patterns that many would not be aware of. I understand it might just be a good idea to explain them first in a blog, but for now - I assume you have at least heard of them and know a thing or two about C++. I'll cover these in future.

Let's start with a basic comparison of using arrays and vectors in C++:

```cpp
// Create an array of fixed size: 10
int* InputArray = new int[10];
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // Let's assign values to the array
    // Values are same as indices
    InputArray[i] = i;
}
```

We can do the same (from what you see above) using `vector`:

```cpp
// Include this to be able to use vector container
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> InputVector {};
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    InputVector.push_back(i);
}
```

While both do the same, but there are many important differences that happen in the backend. Let's start with performance.

* The piece of code using vector containers in C++ took 23.834 microseconds.
* The piece of code using arrays in C++ took 3.26 microseconds.

If we had to do this for 10k numbers, the performance might be significant:

* The piece of code using vector containers in C++ (for 10k numbers) took 713 microseconds.
* The piece of code using arrays in C++ took 173 microseconds.

As in software development, there is always a tradeoff. Since vectors aim to provide dynamic memory allocation, they lose some performance while trying to `push_back` elements in the vectors since the memory is not allocated before. This can be constant if memory is allocated before.

Let's try to infer this from the source code of vector container. The signature of a vector container looks like this:

```cpp
template<typename _Tp, typename _Alloc = std::allocator<_Tp> >
    class vector : protected _Vector_base<_Tp, _Alloc>
```

Where `_Tp` is the type of element, and `_Alloc` is the allocator type (defaults to `std::allocator<_Tp>`). Let's start from the constructor of `vector` (when no parameter is passed):

```cpp
#if __cplusplus >= 201103L
      vector() = default;
#else
      vector() { }
#endif
```

The constructor when called with no params, creates a vector with no elements. As always, there are various ways to initialize a vector object.

I want to focus more on `push_back` today, so let's take a look at it's signature. It's located in `stl_vector.h` file.

```cpp
// Note that value_type is defined as: typedef _Tp value_type as a public type
void push_back(const value_type& __x)
{
    if (this->_M_impl._M_finish != this->_M_impl._M_end_of_storage)
    {
        _GLIBCXX_ASAN_ANNOTATE_GROW(1);
        _Alloc_traits::construct(this->_M_impl, this->_M_impl._M_finish,
                        __x);
        ++this->_M_impl._M_finish;
        _GLIBCXX_ASAN_ANNOTATE_GREW(1);
    }
    else
        _M_realloc_insert(end(), __x);
}
```

A few notes to take:

- `value_type`: This is the type of the elements in the vector container. That is, if the vector is `std::vector<std::vector<int> >`, then value_type of the given vector will be `std::vector<int>`. This comes handy later for type checking and more.
- `_GLIBCXX_ASAN_ANNOTATE_GROW(1)`: The definition of this macro is:
    
    ```cpp
    #define _GLIBCXX_ASAN_ANNOTATE_GROW(n) \
        typename _Base::_Vector_impl::template _Asan<>::_Grow \
            __attribute__((__unused__)) __grow_guard(this->_M_impl, (n))
    ```

    - The base struct `_Vector_base` defines these functions and structs. Let's take a look at struct `_Asan`. Essentially, all we want to do with the above macro is to grow the vector container memory by n. Since when we insert an element, we only need to grow by 1, so we pass 1 to the macro call.
    
    ```cpp
    template<typename = _Tp_alloc_type>
        struct _Asan
        {
            typedef typename __gnu_cxx::__alloc_traits<_Tp_alloc_type>::size_type size_type;

            struct _Grow
            {
                _Grow(_Vector_impl&, size_type) { }
                void _M_grew(size_type) { }
            };

            // ...
        };
    ```
    If usage of Macros is new to you, please leave it for now as we'll discuss more about these design patterns in future.
- A note on usage of `_M_impl`. It is declared as: `_Vector_impl& _M_impl` in the header file. `_Vector_impl` is a struct defined as:

    ```cpp
    struct _Vector_impl : public _Tp_alloc_type, public _Vector_impl_data
    {
        _Vector_impl() _GLIBCXX_NOEXCEPT_IF(is_nothrow_default_constructible<_Tp_alloc_type>::value) : _Tp_alloc_type() { }
    }
    // more overloads for the constructor
    ```

    The base struct `_Vector_impl_data` gives you helpful pointers to access later on:

    ```cpp
    struct _Vector_impl_data
    {
        pointer _M_start;
        pointer _M_finish;
        pointer _M_end_of_storage;

        // overloads of constructors
    }
    ```

    To go deep into the details is not useful here, but as you would have sensed, this helps us to access pointer to the start, finish and end of storage of the vector.

You would have guessed by now, that `push_back` call will add the element to the end (observe `_Alloc_traits::construct(this->_M_impl, this->_M_impl._M_finish, __x);`) and will then increment the variable `_M_finish` by 1.

Note how `push_back` first checks if there is memory available. Of course we have limited memory available with us, and it checks if the end location of the current vector container equals the end storage capacity:

```cpp
if (this->_M_impl._M_finish != this->_M_impl._M_end_of_storage) {
    // ...
} else {
    _M_realloc_insert(end(), __x);
}
```

So if we have reached the end of storage, it calls `_M_realloc_insert(end(), __x)`. Now what is this? Let's take a look at it's definition:

```cpp
template <typename _Tp, typename _Alloc>
  template<typename... _Args>
    void vector<_Tp, _Alloc>::_M_realloc_insert(iterator __position, _Args&&... __args) {
        // ...
        pointer __old_start = this->_M_impl._M_start;
        pointer __old_finish = this->_M_impl._M_finish;
        // Here we have passed __position as end()
        // So __elems_before will be total number of elements in our original vector
        const size_type __elems_before = __position - begin();
        
        // Declare new starting and finishing pointers
        pointer __new_start(this->_M_allocate(__len));
        pointer __new_finish(__new_start);

        __try
        {
            // Allocate memory and copy original vector to the new memory locations
        }
        __catch(...)

        // Destroy the original memory location
        std::_Destroy(__old_start, __old_finish, _M_get_Tp_allocator());
        
        // Change starting, finishing and end of storage pointers to new pointers
        this->_M_impl._M_start = __new_start;
        this->_M_impl._M_finish = __new_finish;
        // here __len is 1
        this->_M_impl._M_end_of_storage = __new_start + __len;
    }
```

Even though the above piece of code might scare a few (it did scare me when I looked at it for the first time), but just saying - this is just 10% of the definition of `_M_realloc_insert`.

If you haven't noticed so far, there is something very puzzling in the code: `template<typename... _Args>` -- these are variadic arguments introduced in C++11. We'll talk about them later in the series of blogs.

Intuitively, by calling `_M_realloc_insert(end(), __x)` all we are trying to do is reallocate memory (end_of_storage + 1), copy the original vector data to the new memory locations, add `__x` and deallocate (or destroy) the original memory in the heap. This also allows to keep vector to have contiguous memory allocation.

For today, I think we discussed a lot about vectors and their implementation in GCC. We'll continue to cover rest of the details in the next part of the blog. I'm sure, the next time you plan to use `push_back` - you'll know how things are happening in the backend. Till then, have fun and take care! :)
